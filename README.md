The aim is to get in touch with the state-of-the-art in software developement. Both the thoeretical
and practical way is important - get to know develope processes ( e.g.: TDD ), get practice in using 
modern tools (e.g.: Jenkins, Git, etc...) 

The first task is to develope a simulator for LED blinky. For this the plan is to use Qt with C++.
